    <p>Stephen Hawking was one of the greatest scientists of the century. He was a very unique person. He proposed and proved many theories. He explained the theory of the black hole, he wrote a book called ‘The Brief History of Time’ in which he explained about the black hole. He also described the concepts of relativity, and big-bang-theory in this book.</p> 
    <p>Stephen Hawking is an inspiration to all of us. He suffered from a fatal motor neuron disease that affected his spinal cord. He was diagnosed with this disease in his early 20’s and doctors predicted that he was not likely to live more than 5years. His body was paralyzed and he moved about in a wheel-chair for the rest of his life. Though he could not sit up straight, yet he kept working on his theories of Physics, and amazed the medical experts by surviving for 55 more years.</p> 
    <p>Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his theories and cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States. In 2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died on 14 March 2018 at the age of 76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.</p>
    <p>Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.[22][23]</p>

<div class="about" id="about">
    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
Stephen Hawking was born in Oxford on January 8, 1942. He was born in very adverse circumstances. His parents were not well off and he was born during the Second World War. It was believed that Germany would attack Britain any time. At that time, Oxford was considered a safe place, so Stephen Hawking’s parents moved to Oxford. His father's name was Frank and his mother's name was Isobel Hawkins. Isobel worked as a secretary in the Medical Research Institute, and Frank was a Medical Researcher. In 1950, when Hawkins's father became the Head of the Division of Parasitology at the National Institute of Medical Research, the family moved to St. Albans.</p>



<p>In the early days of the academy, Stephen Hawking was a good student. He loved board games. According to his friends, Hawkins, along with the rest of his friends, had created a game that only they used to play among themselves. Together with his friends, he had made a computer putting together the recycled parts, so that he could use it to solve the complex mathematical equations. When Stephen Hawking joined the Oxford University, he was 17 years old. He wanted to study Maths there but there was no specialized degree in Maths, so he turned to Physics, and later he turned towards Cosmology. After graduating in natural science in 1962, he went to Cambridge University to pursue a PhD in cosmology. In 1968, he was made a member of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy which gave a new direction to his research. That is when he started research on the black hole. He was then inducted into the Royal Society in 1974, a World Wide Fellowship of Scientists. In 1979, he became an Education Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, that is regarded as the most famous academic chair in the world.</p>

 <h2>Fight with His Disease</h2>    
<p>Stephen Hawking, at the age of 21, was diagnosed with a motor neuron disease (MND) (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)) disease. It is a dangerous neurological disease, due to which the nerve cells that control the movement of the muscles of the body gradually stop working, due to which the body gets paralyzed. When he was in Oxford, he felt many times that he was not well, sometimes he used to fall down suddenly while walking, or used to stop completely while speaking. He became very clumsy. However, he continued to ignore all these things before 1963 and did not tell anyone about it.</p> 

<p>When his father saw his condition in 1963, he took him to the doctor and he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease (MND) (also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)). Doctors said that Stephen Hawking would only be able to stay alive for the next few years. His illness became a big reason for him to carry out his studies and he became a great scientist. Hawking himself said that until he was not diagnosed with the disease, his life was very boring. However, after diagnosis, when he came to know that he would be able to live for only a few years, he had put all his attention in his work and research so that he could fully utilize his remaining life. His illness captured him slowly, and as result, he was no longer able to walk due to which he had to move about in a wheelchair. He lost his voice completely in the year 1985. At this time, his condition was so bad that he was kept in 24 hours medical surveillance, and California’s computer programmers came to help him. They developed software that works based on the eye movement.</p>

    <h2>Contribution Towards Science</h2>
    <p>In his research, he found that if this universe started with the Big Bang, then it would end with Big Bang. He also explained Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. Using the General Theory of Relativity and Quantum Theory together, he gave us the concept of Hawking Radiation in which we came to know that Black Holes do not always exist, they leave the Hawking Radiation continuously. Hawking also explained the concept of Penrose– Hawking theorems, Blackhole information paradox, Micro black hole, Primordial black hole, Chronology protection conjecture, Soft hair (No hair theorem), Bekenstein–Hawking formula, Hawking energy, Hawking-Page phase transition.
</p>
<p>Stephen Hawking's contributions to the understanding of gravity, black holes and cosmology were truly immense. They began with the singularity theorems in the 1960s followed by his discovery that black holes have an entropy and consequently a finite temperature. Black holes were predicted to emit thermal radiation, what is now called Hawking radiation. He pioneered the study of primordial black holes and their potential role in cosmology. His organization of and contributions to the Nuffield Workshop in 1982 consolidated the picture that the large-scale structure of the universe originated as quantum fluctuations during the inflationary era. Work on the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity resulted in his formulation of the concept of the wavefunction of the universe. The tension between quantum mechanics and general relativity led to his struggles with the information paradox concerning deep connections between these fundamental areas of physics.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stephen Hawking died on 14 March 2018 at his home. A man whose body didn’t support him, achieved all so much, that he became an inspiration for the next generations. Stephen Hawking used to give lecturers even when he was not well. Motivate people to do a PhD. Stephen Hawking always used to say the same thing, no matter how much difficult may life be, you can always do something, you can be successful if you work hard. An inspirational message for every people.</p>
